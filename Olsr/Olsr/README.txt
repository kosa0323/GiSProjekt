and based on studies funded within the European project Workpad, offers 
a free code under license GPL v3 with which any developer will be able to 
deploy a MANET (AD-HOC Network, Meshnet) with protocol OLSR. The project 
has been developed for Windows Mobile 6, Windows XP and can be adapted to 
other platforms that have the NET Framework or Compact Framework with some 
restrictions.
